          <h1>FAQ</h1>

          <p>
            Here at We Did It Global we get lots of questions from our artists
            regarding various aspects of our service. To make it easier, we
            decided to make a collection of the most frequently asked questions
            and give you the answers below. Check them out, and maybe you’ll
            find the answer that you’ve been looking for.
          </p>
        </div>



        <div class="card">
          <span> How long is the contract?</span>
          <p>
            It is 10 years contract generally, members are allowed to exit on
            completion of year 3, year 5 or year 7 paying an exit fee.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <span>Why do you keep 30% from all earning?</span>

          <p>
            We do not take any commission from public performing royalties nor
            collect them in Sri Lanka. 100% (less any admin fee by the
            collector) public performing royalties should be paid to you by
            the relevant CMO that collect it for you in Sri Lanka We have
            provided over 150 authors and composers a free membership to
            register them worldwide, to register you and your songs to make
            them eligible to earn required specialist acknowledged as well as
            international operations that require adequate staffing, resources
            and funding. Only way we can make our investment back is by
            keeping a commission from the earning we made possible for you.
            Company also will recreate your songs to make further earning
            potentials and keep them popular in the public. We also have tax
            obligations and other commitments such as licensing, monitoring
            and maintain our services and products which all require funds to
            operate correctly to earn on your rights.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <span> Why does my song say it’s ‘pending’?</span>
          <p>
            This usually means we’re in the process of getting the song
            registered at the PROs/CMOs. Once you’ve added a new song to the
            website, we need to send this information off to the different
            collection societies in order to set up registrations.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <span> I’ve not been paid for my radio/tv play. </span>

          <p>
            Radio and television royalties (Please do not get confused with
            licence and royalty pay) should come through automatically about
            9-12 months after the date of the broadcast and, because of this,
            we are unable to proactively make claims for broadcasts like we
            can for other platforms. However, we can follow up with the CMO if
            you haven’t been paid for specific broadcasts after 12 months –
            that’s why it’s a good idea to keep your We Did It Global account
            up to date with any broadcasts you’re aware of.

        <div class="card">
          <span> How can I claim royalties from YouTube? </span>

          <p>
            If your music is receiving substantial views on YouTube or if you
            know it is being used without your permission on the platform then
            please email info@wediditglobal.com to ensure it has been
            delivered to YouTube’s Content ID platform, ensure it is protected
            and where possible royalties are being generated. What the
            difference between Royalty Pay and Licencing Pay Royalty pay is
            that generate after a song been broadcasted whereas Licencing Pay
            required to be paid before using the songs been broadcasted known
            as “Blanket Licensing” or before attempting to remake/reproduced
            such as in reality TV programs
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <span> Why haven’t I been paid for the use in public yet? </span>

          <p>
            In Sri Lanka there is no proper mechanism to collect royalties
            from public performing yet. Crucially lack of active Collective
            Management Organisation for authors and composers as well as for
            the publishers such as We Did It Global. Once a CMO established
            and operational as a rough guide, royalties from smaller venues
            (pubs and small venues) can take 6-9 months to come through;
            royalties from larger venues (academies, for example) usually take
            9-12 months to come through and royalties from overseas venues and
            festivals can take a year or more to come through. It’s important
            to note that this waiting time begins when We Did It Global
            creates your IPI number from the COMPASS (our COMs) and register
            your songs in the worldwide catalogue.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <span> What’s my IPI number? </span>

          <p>
            IPI number know as Interested Party Information if the unique ID
            as an Author or composer. This number is created for you by the
            Collective Management Organisation and all your music and lyrics
            are registered under the IPI number for easy reference and royalty
            collection.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <span> How do I get paid? </span>

          <p>
            You will be paid your share of any performance royalties worldwide
            except Sri Lanka directly by the COMPASS, your CMO. Any other
            earning from mechanical royalties We Did It Global makes
            distributions quarterly in January, April, July and October. You
            will receive an email statement from us if the balance of your
            account totals over LKR 1000. We will pay out any amount above RS
            1000 directly to the payment information you have provided us in
            your name.

        <div class="card">
          <span>
            Why don’t you automatically collect my Neighbouring Rights
            royalties?
          </span>
          <p>
            Neighbouring Rights refer to the royalties owed for the broadcast
            of the master recordings. As a publisher we do not traditionally
            represent the master recordings of our artists. This usually falls
            under the role of the label; however, it is becoming more common
            for artists to retain their master rights and We Did It Global has
            a separate label when this is the case, we can represent the
            master rights holder share and collect their Neighbouring Rights
            royalties on our clients’ behalf. Apparently my song got played on
            a TV show, was this through We Did It Global? The way TV should
            works in the Sri Lanka is under blanket license deals, so any
            producer can use any track at any-time as long as the tracks are
            registered with the CMO in Sri Lanka which is yet to establish or
            to proactively licence use of songs on their original publication.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <span> Can I claim royalties for a cover song I have created?</span>
          <p>
            We are unable to collect royalties for cover songs. As a
            publisher, we collect for any original compositions on behalf of
            the original songwriters.
